# Clustering (w/ Python & R)
This repository contains the Clustering algorithms in R and Python (Hierarchical Clustering &amp; K-Means Clustering). Implemented to analyze the similar group of customers from the Mall Customer Data.

# **Project name:** Clustering (w/ Python & R)

## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clustering is a machine learning technique that sets observation points into cluster or subsets. The observations in the same cluster is similar in some sense.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this repository, we are focusing on building complex statistical Clustering models to customers dataset to distinguish different possible groups of customers  and visualize the results. Clustering is an unsupervised learning method
and a very common technique for statistical data analysis which is crucial in many fields.


## Installation 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to apply these regression techniques to predict outcome on your dataset you need to have following tools and libraries:
  * Python 2.x or Python 3.x
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Scikit-Learn
  * R (For R implementation)

## Usage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clustering methodes are very common term and technique in the field of data science. You can use these clustering techniques to distinguish different types of clusters from your datasets of students, customers and more to find the similar groups of student and customers, 
which can help us focus on group of observation with similar features rather than focusing on individual datapoint.

## Contributing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can implement both models on the same dataset to determine the most accurate model.

## Credits 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was an individual project.
